# Hello. Welcome to my project github. 

The 'code' folder contains all code scripts/RMD files for data processing/cleaning, exploration, and analysis. 

HERE ARE THE STEPS TO REPRODUCE MY ANALYSIS

1) Run the Processing_Cleaning.R located in the processing_code folder. This loads in all the datasets, merges, and cleans them.

2) Run the Descriptive_Exploration.Rmd located in the analysis_code folder. This performs descriptive analysis on the data, producing several tables and plots to be used in the manuscript.

3) Run the Modeling_Simple.Rmd located in the analysis_code folder. This runs simple and multivariate models on the data and saves different tables needed for the manuscript.

4) Run the Modeling_Advanced.R located in the analysis_code folder. This runs the full analysis trying several different models (simple, multivariate, LASSO, decision tree) and saves different plots and tables needed for the manuscript.

5) Run the Final_Draft.Rmd located in the products-> manuscript folder. Knitting this document will produce my manuscript. It includes references that were imported from Endnote. The reference file is located in the manuscript tab and named bibliography.bibtex. Supplemental_Material.Rmd contains plots and tables mentioned in the main text, but not included.
