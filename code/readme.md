# Hello Dr. Handel. Welcome to my project github. 

Part 2 of my project is located in the products folder. You can knit the Project Part 2.RMD to see all my steps for cleaning, merging, wrangling, and exploring of the data.


There is also a copy of the processing code in the processing_code folder titled Processing.RMD.
