# Hello Dr. Handel. Welcome to my project github. 


Part 3 of my project is located in the products tab under the manuscript folder. It includes a more polished draft of the paper with plots and tables. If you knit that to HTML, it should reproduce what I did. 

I also added modelingscript.R to the analysis_code folder. Here you can see my steps for running the simple and multivariate linear regression models used in the paper. 


Part 2 of my project is located in the products folder. You can knit the Project Part 2.RMD to see all my steps for cleaning, merging, wrangling, and exploring of the data.


There is also a copy of the processing RMD in the processing_code folder titled Processing_Exploration.RMD. This also shows the steps to cleaning and processing the data.
