The raw_data files contain all data used for the analysis. Due to the vaccination data being to large for Github, I had to do in another R script before adding the vaccination data to my repository. This is marked in the Processing.RMD and under Project Part 2.RMD. 

The file, processed_data contains the cleaned data that will be used for further analysis.
