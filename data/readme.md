The raw_data files contain all data used for the analysis. Due to the vaccination data being to large for Github, I had to do in another R script before adding the vaccination data to my repository. This code is written out and marked in the Processing.RMD and under Project Part 2.RMD. 

Note: Three of the datasets, Education, PovertyEstimates, and Unemployment went through minor tweaks in excel before importing. There was some documentation on the first few lines before the actual data that was deleted. I also converted these from exce to csv files before importing into R. The original files can be found in the raw data folder as "Education_Original," "PovertyEstimates_Original", and "Unemployment_Original"

The file, processed_data contains the cleaned data that will be used for further analysis.
