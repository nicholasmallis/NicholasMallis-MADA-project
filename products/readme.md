# Hello Dr. Handel. Welcome to my project github. 

Part 3 of my project is located in the products tab under the manuscript folder. It includes a more polished draft of the paper with plots and tables. If you knit that to HTML, it should reproduce what I did. I also added modelingscript.R to the analysis_code folder. Here you can see my steps for running the simple and multivariate linear regression models used in the paper. 


Part 2 of my project is located in the products folder under manuscript. You can knit the Project Part 2.RMD to see all my steps for cleaning, merging, wrangling, and exploring of the data.
