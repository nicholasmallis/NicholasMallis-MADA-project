## Results: Simple Linear Regression Model

The figures and tables below examine the bivariate associations between each predicator and the outcome. Looking at the main exposure, education, we see that a one unit increase in percent of county with bachelor’s degree is associated with 1.02 unit increase in vaccination rate (p< 0.0001). This is displayed graphically in the scatterplot and linear regression overlay in figure 2. Table 3 shows the performance statistics on this model. The simple model had an r-squared value of 0.12 and an AIC of 26673.85.

Simple Models with Covariates
A one unit increase in county median income is associated with a slight increase (0.0004) in vaccination rate (p< 0.0001). This is displayed graphically in the scatter plot and linear regression overlay in figure 3. Regarding poverty rate, we see that a one unit increase in poverty rate is associated with a .78 decrease in vaccination rate (p< 0.0001). This is displayed graphically in the scatter plot and linear regression overlay in figure 4. A one unit increase in unemployment rate is associated with a 0.86 decrease in vaccination rate (p< 0.0001). This is displayed graphically in the scatter plot and linear regression overlay in figure 5. The mean vaccination rate is 7.5 percentage points units lower in non-metro areas compared with metro areas (p< 0.0001). This is displayed graphically in the stratified boxplots in figure 6.

## Results: Multivariate Regression Model
Table 8 below displays the results to the multivariate regression model.  When controlling for other covariates, a one unit increase in percent of county with a bachelor’s degree was associated with 0.82 unit increase in vaccination rate (p< 0.0001). Table 9 shows the performance statistics on the multivariate regression model with all predictors. Here we see that the r-squared value was 0.16 and the AIC was 26534.57. The multivariate model had a higher r-squared value and a lower AIC compared with the simple model, indicating that it might be a better fit, but model improvements will be made in the next steps to assure that we are using the best model.
